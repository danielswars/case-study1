Let's pretend the service would already be live and in use. And we identified some improvements which we would like to make to the service.

1. Add `more customer data`: We would like to have those data fields stored inside the service: name, address, phone number
2. The result of the getCustomers becomes `too large` when we saved a lot of customers. Is there a way to circumvent that?
3. The `error-handling` is not optimal. The clients have difficulties retrieving the information on what went wrong and how to solve it. How can we improve that?
4. We noticed that we sometimes have `duplicate` customer numbers inside the application. How can we prevent that?
5. The `range` of possible customer numbers is not enough. We would like to have a way to extend that range.
6. We have other services which want to get updates about changes in the customer data. How can we `forward the information`?
7. We noticed some `performance issues` for getCustomer when we have a lot of saved customer documents. Is there a way to improve that?
8. The `test coverage` is not optimal. We would like to have all critical use cases tested.

You can either do the improvements by yourself and present them to us afterward. **_Or_** we can do the improvements together in a pair-programming session.

You can decide which way you prefer. You can also do a mix of the two options and prepare already parts of the improvements, and we will do the rest together.
